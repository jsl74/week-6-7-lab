## What the program does
This program will ask the user for various inputs: name, game, and favorite color. Then, after individually printing those inputs, the end result will be all the inputs concatenated. Essentially, you get a nice ditty!

## Installation and Usage
Clone the software from https://github.com/jsl74/week-6-7-lab, and make sure you have the latest python installed. If you are on Windows, type in cmd on the start menu. If you are on Mac, go to Utilities > Terminal, and if you are on linux, Open the Terminal through either the start menu or by right clicking. Input into the terminal `python code.py` and that runs it. When you see "Enter your name!" that means you should welll, enter your name. After some more prompts, it should print out a nice ditty. 

## How to contribute
Fork the project, add any changes you may find helpful and we'll review it. Then, after reviewing it, we'll give you any tips and suggestions to patch it up if need be, and then resubmit. If it's all good, youv'e contributed. (Hooorraaaayyyy!!!!!)
