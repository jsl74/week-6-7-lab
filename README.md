This program will ask the user for various inputs: name, game, and favorite color. Then, after individually printing those inputs, the end result will be all the inputs concatenated. 

COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION LICENSE was chosen because it's a simple program and doesn't require specific ownership or recognition for further development, use or distribution. 

Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct was chosen because of its specific guidelines on acceptable behavior, inclusion of a contact method to report inappropriate behavior, and overall acceptable standards to contributing in the community.
